# CONTRIBUTING

## Open / pickup an issue for preparation

If you find a typo in a document, find a bug in code or want new features, or want to give suggestions, you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/alibaba/Nacos/issues/new) to report it.

## Begin your contribution

Now if you want to contribute, please create a new pull request.

We use the `master` branch as the development branch, which indicates that this is an unstable branch.

Now, if you are ready to create PR, here is the workflow for contributors:

1.  Fork to your own.

2.  Clone fork to a local repository.

3.  Create a new branch and work on it.

4.  Keep your branch in sync.

5.  Commit your changes (make sure your commit message is concise).

6.  Push your commits to your forked repository.

7.  Create a pull request to **master** branch.

When creating pull request:

1.  Please create the request to **master** branch.

2.  If it is a big bug fix or new feature, add a new issue to this repo. If it is a tiny change, you can just pull request without a issue.

3.  If the PR has a corresponding issue, name it with [ISSUE #{issue_id}] **.

4.  If your PR contains large changes, e.g. component refactor or new components, please write detailed documents about its design and usage.

5.  Note that a single PR should not be too large. If heavy changes are required, it's better to separate the changes to a few individual PRs.

6.  **Before merging a PR, squash any fix review feedback, typo, merged and rebased sorts of commits. The final commit message should be clear and concise.**

If your PR contains large changes, e.g. component refactor or new components, please write detailed documents about its design and usage.
